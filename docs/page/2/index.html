			<div class="post-content">
				<p>My recipe for a strawberry hydromel (low alcohol mead). Ready to drink in 3-4 weeks.
 2kg strawberries
Frozen or fresh will do. Hull and then chop them into small (~2cm) chunks and place them into a pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil then simmer until the water is a deep red and strawberries have lost most of their colour - about 25 minutes. Strain through a sieve and/or cheesecloth.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Here is my recipe for the simplest, cheapest way to make a nice apple wine. It comes out between 10-12% ABV and tastes pretty good.
Yields 5l (UK gallon).
 5l of apple juice from concentrate

				<p>I&rsquo;ve used Ilford LC29 almost exclusively for a year now so I thought it would be a good time to detail my experience with it since there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much love for it out there.
I think it&rsquo;s a great solution for most casual photographers - shooting a few rolls a month at varying speeds and not having a lot of time to mess around.
 It&rsquo;s economical The going rate is around £20 for 500ml.  … </p>
