		<div class="post-content">

<p>I&rsquo;ve used Ilford LC29 almost exclusively for a year now so I thought it would be a good time to detail my experience with it since there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much love for it out there.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s a great solution for most casual photographers - shooting a few rolls a month at varying speeds and not having a lot of time to mess around.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s economical</strong>
The going rate is around £20 for 500ml. If it takes 300ml of diluted developer to develop a single 35mm roll film at 1+9 dilution, that&rsquo;s only 30ml per roll which is ~£0.67 per roll. At 1+19 dilution that halves to £0.34. Weaker dilutions cut the cost per roll down even further.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>It lasts ages</strong>
I go through a 500ml bottle on average every 6 months. As a general rule I add 5-10% development time for each month it has been open.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>It&rsquo;s ridiculously versatile</strong>
I can pull and push from 50 to 3200ASA without losing detail or over softening/sharpening, I can cross develop C41 with scarily clean results, I can stand develop when I can&rsquo;t be bothered agitating every minute. I feel like there&rsquo;s nothing this developer can&rsquo;t do&hellip;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The best summary I can think of is that it&rsquo;s a halfway point between a traditional developer and Rodinal - it&rsquo;s great for <strong>low volume</strong> work of low <em>and</em> high speeds over the course of several months, all without losing too much detail to oversharpening.</p>

<h3 id="my-developing-times">My developing times</h3>

<p>Some of the development times listed on the box and Ilford&rsquo;s website are wrong!</p>

<p>These are the times I use, based on experimentation. All at room temperature (~20°C) and one agitation per minute, except where noted.</p>
