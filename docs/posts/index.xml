      <title>DIY Function Generator Project</title>

      <description>Working on electronics without a way of generating signals involves a lot of guesswork and dead ends. Since a proper function generator is a bit out of my price range, I set out to try and create my own specifically for audio and RF projects!
On the whole the project was a success, although it is far from perfect and there are quite a few things I&amp;rsquo;d like to change and implement in a future version before making the CAD files and firmware publicly available.</description>

      <title>Coffee Mead</title>

      <description>My recipe for a coffee mead that comes out at about 14%. High alcohol and high caffeine content are always a good mix.
For me it took about 10 weeks to ferment out, and took another good 2-3 months before it lost its jet fuel tang. Completely rank when I first bottled it but it slowly became really pleasant. Probably more of a winter drink than a summer one.
Yields 5l (1 UK gallon).</description>

      <title>Imaginary Landscapes: Generative Muzak In The Browser</title>

      <description>Imaginary Landscapes creates a random, constantly evolving colour and soundscape in your web browser.
The music it creates isn&amp;rsquo;t of any value on its own - it&amp;rsquo;s not really meant to be directly listened to at all, rather passively consumed.
For best results play at low volume on headphones or external loudspeakers and add some context. Leave it on in the background while you’re doing something else, while on the train, while reading a book, having a conversation.</description>

      <title>Wankie: How To Make Your Own Off-Brand Winkie</title>

      <description>On Ep. 114 of CheapShow, Paul and Eli found a bizarre French single promoting a failed electronic pin badge called Winkie.
It&amp;rsquo;s just a badge that alternates between a red and green LED every second. It sounds incredibly dull but somehow it&amp;rsquo;s not.
I found myself so far down the rabbit hole, I decided to design a clone.
I present to you, Wankie:
This post will go through how I designed it and how to make your own (if you can etch your own circuit boards&amp;hellip;)</description>

      <title>Takin&#39; Me Away From You Train Chords</title>

      <description>A nice little song by a seemingly overlooked folk singer named Len Chandler.
 These chords are transcribed from his appearance on Pete Seeger&amp;rsquo;s Rainbow Quest which I think is the best recording of the song. Len released a few studio albums during the mid-late 60s but they all sound a bit forced and over-produced to me - the live recordings he appears on are well worth a listen
While this particular song is more personal and sentimental, he first became known as a protest singer during the civil rights movement.</description>

      <title>Simple Strawberry Session Mead</title>

      <description>My recipe for a strawberry hydromel (low alcohol mead). Ready to drink in 3-4 weeks.
 2kg strawberries
Frozen or fresh will do. Hull and then chop them into small (~2cm) chunks and place them into a pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil then simmer until the water is a deep red and strawberries have lost most of their colour - about 25 minutes. Strain through a sieve and/or cheesecloth.</description>

      <title>Simple Apple Wine</title>

      <description>Here is my recipe for the simplest, cheapest way to make a nice apple wine. It comes out between 10-12% ABV and tastes pretty good.
Yields 5l (UK gallon).
 5l of apple juice from concentrate
It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t contain any additives, except ascorbic acid which is just the posh name for vitamin C. In my experience the price/quality doesn&amp;rsquo;t impact on the final product, so I&amp;rsquo;d reccomend just using supermakret own brand.</description>

      <description>This project started off with the idea of creating a chatbot that speaks through a typewriter. I&amp;rsquo;ve not got round to making the chatbot part yet, but I probably will in the future. The major hurdle of course was making the typing work.
Here it is booting up:
Your browser does not support the video tag.  Concept The typewriter I got uses matrix polling to determine what keys to type.</description>

      <title>LC29 B&amp;W Film Developer Review</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used Ilford LC29 almost exclusively for a year now so I thought it would be a good time to detail my experience with it since there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much love for it out there.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great solution for most casual photographers - shooting a few rolls a month at varying speeds and not having a lot of time to mess around.
 It&amp;rsquo;s economical The going rate is around £20 for 500ml.</description>
