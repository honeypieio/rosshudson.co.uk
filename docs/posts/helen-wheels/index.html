<p>This project started off with the idea of creating a chatbot that speaks through a typewriter. I&rsquo;ve not got round to making the chatbot part yet, but I probably will in the future. The major hurdle of course was making the typing work.</p>

<p>Here it is booting up:</p>

<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>

<p>The typewriter I got uses matrix polling to determine what keys to type.</p>

<p>This means that it has two 8 bit buses - a scan bus and a return bus. Each line of the scan bus is &ldquo;probed&rdquo; several times a second. The other circuitry in the typewriter then detects what active scan line(s) are grounded through which return line(s). Essentially, each character you can type corresponds with a combination of lines shorted together.</p>

<h3 id="circuitry">Circuitry</h3>

<p>So in able to simulate these lines being shorted together, I opted to created 2 &ldquo;arrays&rdquo; of N-channel MOSFETs, with their drains and sources commoned together.</p>

<p><img src="/images/helen-wheels/mosfet-configuration.png" /></p>

<p>This meant I could control the current flow between whatever scan and return lines I wanted. To bias (&ldquo;turn on&rdquo;) the MOSFETs, I used two 74HC595N shift registers. I fed the shift registers the data via a Raspberry Pi Zero</p>

<p><img src="/images/helen-wheels/circuitry.jpg" /></p>

<p><small>Note: the resistors are to pulldown any floating grounds</small></p>

<p>On the typewriter&rsquo;s board, I desoldered the edge connector that the original keyboard slotted into and repaced it with standard 0.1&rdquo; male dupont connectors. Then I tapped the rectified side of the main input diode bridge and used a 5v buck converter to power the RPi and the shift registers.</p>

<p>Here is all the circuitry put together.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<p>I took the membrane out of the keyboard and took photos of each side, as well as the keyboard layout itself. I then put these images into photoshop and traced out what combination of lines corresponded with what keys. From this I created a <a href="https://github.com/honeypieio/helen-wheels/blob/master/type/keymap.py">keymap</a>.</p>

<p>For example the character &ldquo;o&rdquo; has the following lines active on the scan and return buses respectively (represented as two bytes):</p>

<p>00001000
00000100</p>

<p>I then wrote the program that utilises this data.</p>

<p>It iterates through each character in the string to be typed and finds the corresponding bytes from the keymap, then shifts them out to both registers.</p>

<p>I found the optimum keying delay was 0.05 seconds, which is pretty fast!</p>

<hr />

<p>Here it is at full speed typing out a test sentence:</p>

<h3 id="now-what">Now What?</h3>

<p>I have a few ideas on how to use this.
As mentioned before a chatbot is one possibility. That would involve installing a microphone, which can be complicated with a Raspberry Pi as it only has digital inputs&hellip;</p>

<p>Another idea would be using a machine learning corpus to make it automatically type out stupid, made-up poems or movie scripts</p>

<p>Essentially anything that prints to the screen can co-opt the program I&rsquo;ve written to type its output on the typewriter rather than a console or a file.</p>
