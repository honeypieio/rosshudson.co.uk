		<div class="post-content"><p>My recipe for a coffee mead that comes out at about 14%. High alcohol and high caffeine content are always a good mix.</p>

<p>For me it took about 10 weeks to ferment out, and took another good 2-3 months before it lost its jet fuel tang. Completely rank when I first bottled it but it slowly became really pleasant. Probably more of a winter drink than a summer one.</p>

<p>Yields 5l (1 UK gallon).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(slightly less than) 5l of cold brew coffee</p>

<p>Leave a 1:4 ground coffee to water mixture overight. The next day, strain it through some cheesecloth into a demijohn. I used Columbian but I think any low-acidity coffee will work&hellip;</p></li>

<li><p>1.3kg of honey</p></li>

<li><p>Yeast</p>

<p>I used a general wine yeast but the fermentation stalled about half way. I added some EC-1118 champagne yeast which got it going again and fermented it to completion - so use that (or something similar)</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note on gravity measurements</strong></p>

<p>The gravity of the unfermented mead will be offset by the gravity of the coffee. For example my coffee had a gravity of 1.010 so I when I was checking the progress of the fermentation I was referencing the gravity of the coffee as the point at which the mead would be dry (which is usually 1.000)</p>

<p>This is assuming there&rsquo;s no fermentable stuff in the coffee itself which could be totally wrong but it seemed to work out for me.</p>
