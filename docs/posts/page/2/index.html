			<div class="post-content">
				<p>On Ep. 114 of CheapShow, Paul and Eli found a bizarre French single promoting a failed electronic pin badge called Winkie.
It&rsquo;s just a badge that alternates between a red and green LED every second. It sounds incredibly dull but somehow it&rsquo;s not.
I found myself so far down the rabbit hole, I decided to design a clone.
I present to you, Wankie:
This post will go through how I designed it and how to make your own (if you can etch your own circuit boards&hellip;)  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>A nice little song by a seemingly overlooked folk singer named Len Chandler.
 These chords are transcribed from his appearance on Pete Seeger&rsquo;s Rainbow Quest which I think is the best recording of the song. Len released a few studio albums during the mid-late 60s but they all sound a bit forced and over-produced to me - the live recordings he appears on are well worth a listen
While this particular song is more personal and sentimental, he first became known as a protest singer during the civil rights movement.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>My recipe for a strawberry hydromel (low alcohol mead). Ready to drink in 3-4 weeks.
 2kg strawberries
Frozen or fresh will do. Hull and then chop them into small (~2cm) chunks and place them into a pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil then simmer until the water is a deep red and strawberries have lost most of their colour - about 25 minutes. Strain through a sieve and/or cheesecloth.  … </p>

			<h1><a href="https://rosshudson.co.uk/posts/simple-apple-wine/">Simple Apple Wine</a> </h1>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>Here is my recipe for the simplest, cheapest way to make a nice apple wine. It comes out between 10-12% ABV and tastes pretty good.
Yields 5l (UK gallon).
 5l of apple juice from concentrate
It shouldn&rsquo;t contain any additives, except ascorbic acid which is just the posh name for vitamin C. In my experience the price/quality doesn&rsquo;t impact on the final product, so I&rsquo;d reccomend just using supermakret own brand.  … </p>

			<div class="post-content">
				<p>This project started off with the idea of creating a chatbot that speaks through a typewriter. I&rsquo;ve not got round to making the chatbot part yet, but I probably will in the future. The major hurdle of course was making the typing work.
Here it is booting up:
Your browser does not support the video tag.  Concept The typewriter I got uses matrix polling to determine what keys to type.  … </p>
