I've used Ilford LC29 almost exclusively for a year now so I thought it would be a good time to detail my experience with it since there doesn't seem to be much love for it out there.

I think it's a great solution for most casual photographers - shooting a few rolls a month at varying speeds and not having a lot of time to mess around.

1. **It's economical**
   The going rate is around £20 for 500ml. If it takes 300ml of diluted developer to develop a single 35mm roll film at 1+9 dilution, that's only 30ml per roll which is ~£0.67 per roll. At 1+19 dilution that halves to £0.34. Weaker dilutions cut the cost per roll down even further.

2. **It lasts ages**
   I go through a 500ml bottle on average every 6 months. As a general rule I add 5-10% development time for each month it has been open.

3. **It's ridiculously versatile**
   I can pull and push from 50 to 3200ASA without losing detail or over softening/sharpening, I can cross develop C41 with scarily clean results, I can stand develop when I can't be bothered agitating every minute. I feel like there's nothing this developer can't do...


The best summary I can think of is that it's a halfway point between a traditional developer and Rodinal - it's great for **low volume** work of low *and* high speeds over the course of several months, all without losing too much detail to oversharpening.

### My developing times

Some of the development times listed on the box and Ilford's website are wrong!

These are the times I use, based on experimentation. All at room temperature (~20°C) and one agitation per minute, except where noted.

**HP5 Plus**

| Speed         | Dilution      | Time  |
| ------------- |---------------| ----- |
| 200ASA        | 1+19          | 5:30  |
| 400ASA        | 1+19          | 7:00  |
| 800ASA        | 1+19          | 10:00 |
| 3200ASA       | 1+9           | 20:00 |
| 3200ASA       | 1+49          | 50:00*|

\* Stand development - one agitation at the beginning and one halfway through.

**Kodak XX**

| Speed         | Dilution      | Time  |
| ------------- |---------------| ----- |
| 250ASA        | 1+29          | 8:00  |

**C41**

| Speed         | Dilution      | Time  |
| ------------- |---------------| ----- |
| 50-400ASA     | 1+19          | 7:00  |
