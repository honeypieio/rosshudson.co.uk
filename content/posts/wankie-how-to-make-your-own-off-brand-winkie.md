On [Ep. 114 of Cheapshow](https://www.thecheapshow.co.uk/ep-114-winkie), Paul and Eli found a bizzare French single promoting a failed pin badge called Winkie. It sounds incredibly dull, but it's really not - I've since become obsessed with it.

As it turns out they're quite pricey and rare, so I decided to make my own off-brand version dubbed Wankie:

If you would like to make your own Wankie you're in luck (if you can etch your own circuit boards).

### Circuit Board

To make the circuit board, you'll need a double sided piece of laminate, at least 50x50mm.  

The link below is a PDF with the layout to scale for an A4 page.

I won't go into detail how to etch boards at home but here's a few tips for photo-etching a double sided board:

* To make sure both sides are aligned properly, leave a leader of about 25mm at the top and bottom of both transparencies. Line both transparencies up whilst holding them flat and taut, then sellotape or staple **each** leader together.

* Cut off a small corner of your transparencies and the laminate. This means you can be sure you're exposing it the the same way round on each side, it can be easy to lose track of orientation when flipping the board over and peeling off the protective film.

### Materials

It's a bit unorthodox but it is made out of widely-available, standard parts. Here's a list of what you need:

### Instructions

I'll assume you have a blank PCB ready to go.

First off, I apply some PCB varnish to the front - it'll make it last longer. You can use clear nail varnish instead.

Next I solder the large pads for the negative battery contact and the pin back.
