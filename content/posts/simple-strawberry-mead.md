My recipe for a strawberry hydromel (low alcohol mead). Ready to drink in 3-4 weeks.

- 2kg strawberries

    Frozen or fresh will do. Hull and then chop them into small (~2cm) chunks and place them into a pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil then simmer until the water is a deep red and strawberries have lost most of their colour - about 25 minutes. Strain through a sieve and/or cheesecloth.

- 650g honey

    Any honey should work but clear is easiest easiest to use.   

    *Tip: sit the jar(s)/bottle(s) of honey in a hot water bath for 20 minutes before use - this will make pouring easier and faster.*

- Yeast

    Any general beer/ale/wine yeast will work.

- Water to fill

Yields 5l (1 UK gallon).
