The simplest, cheapest, idiot-proofiest way to make a nice apple wine.
(*This recipe assumes some basic homebrewing experience. See [this guide](https://www.winebags.com/Beginner-s-Guide-To-Making-Wine-At-Home-s/1836.htm) for a more general overview*)

Equipment:

- 5l (UK Gallon) demijohn/fermentation bucket
- Airlock
- Siphon w/ bottling wand
- Bottles

Ingredients:

- 5l of *cheap* apple juice from concentrate with *no additives except ascorbic acid* (the expensive makes no difference to the final product)
- 600g sugar
- Wine yeast
- Black tea (optional)

Method:

0. Make some tea (optional)
    Make a cup of black tea in the normal way. Adding it to the wine will give it some [tannins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenolic_content_in_wine#Tannins). Let it steep and cool for a while.

1. Hydrate the yeast
    *Note on yeast: any general wine yeast will do*

    Put half a packet of yeast into a cup and add enough apple juice to cover it twice. Swirl it around a bit.

2. Add the apple juice
    Pour 4 litres or so of the apple juice into the demijohn. If you have a small-necked demijohn, using a funnel will make this a million times easier.

3. Add the sugar
    Add about half of the sugar and shake the demijohn until it has all dissolved into the apple juice. Repeat until all the sugar has dissolved into the apple juice. **Leave it for a minute to see if any sugar settles out** - if it does just shake it some more

4. Add the tea (optional)
    If you made a cup of tea, now would be the time to pour it in. **Make sure it is cool/lukewarm, if it's still hot it may kill the yeast in the next step**

5. Add (pitch) the yeast
    Pour the cup of apple juice and yeast into the demijohn. Use the remaining apple juice to wash out the cup and get all the yeast out.

6. Fill up the demijohn
    Use the rest of the apple juice to fill up the demijohn, leaving around 7-10cm (3-4 inches) of headroom.

7. Wait 6-8 weeks
    Put the airlock in and leave the demijohn on a towel at room temperature for 6-8 weeks. It will start to bubble after a few days. If it doesn't bubble after a week try pitching more yeast.

8. Bottle it
    Once the wine has stopped bubbling and has started to clear, use a siphon with a bottling wand to get it into bottles. Be sure not to stir up the sediment at the bottom (if you do, just let it sit for a day and it will settle to the bottom again).
    Note: always store the bottles upright!

9. Tasting it
    Taste the wine - if it's not to your liking, leave it for a month and try again. The taste, clarity and colour of the wine will change over time. The last few batches I've made mellowed and cleared out after two weeks.
