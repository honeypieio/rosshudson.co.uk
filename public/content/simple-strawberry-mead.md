How to make a simple low-alcohol strawberry mead (hydromel)

(*This recipe assumes some basic homebrewing experience. See [this guide](https://www.winebags.com/Beginner-s-Guide-To-Making-Wine-At-Home-s/1836.htm) for a more general overview*)

Equipment:

- 5l (UK Gallon) demijohn/fermentation bucket
- Airlock
- Siphon w/ bottling wand
- Bottles
- Cheesecloth/fine muslin bag
- Potato masher

Ingredients:

- 2kg fresh strawberries
- Honey (ASDA own-brand, "pure Honey" 908g)
- Water
- Wine yeast

Method:

1. Prepare the strawberries
    Hull (chop the heads off) all the strawberries then give them a quick wash.

2. Mash the strawberries
    Place the prepared strawberries in a pot and half cover them with water. Put the pot over the lowest heat possible and mash the strawberries.

3. Squeeze out the strawberry juices
    Once sufficiently mashed, place the strawberry pulp in the cheesecloth and squeeze into another pot or jug. Make sure no solids are in the extracted juice - strain it multiple times if needs be.

4. Add honey
    Add the jar of honey to the extracted strawberry juice and stir until it all becomes one syrup.

    Tip: sit the jar of honey in a basin of hot water for a few minutes to make it easier to mix.

5. Add the honey/strawberry syrup
    Pour the syrup into the the demijohn, using a spoon to get in any last drops.

6. Add the water
    Fill up the demijohn halfway with water. Shake the demijohn until the water and the syrup have combined. Fill up with more water leaving -10cm (3-4 inches) of headroom. Shake again until combined. If the mixture separates out after a few minutes, shake it again.

7. Add (pitch) the yeast
    Carefully tip in half a packet of wine yeast.

8. Wait 3-4 weeks
    Put the airlock in and leave the demijohn on a towel at room temperature for 3-4 weeks. It will start to bubble after a few days. If it doesn’t bubble after a week try pitching more yeast.

9. Bottle it
    Once the wine has stopped bubbling and has started to clear, use a siphon with a bottling wand to get it into bottles. Be sure not to stir up the sediment at the bottom (if you do, just let it sit for a day and it will settle to the bottom again). Note: always store the bottles upright!

10. Tasting it
    Taste the wine - if it’s not to your liking, leave it for a week and try again. The taste, clarity and colour of the wine will change over time.
